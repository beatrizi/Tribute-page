# Tribute-page
This website was Build following the instruction of [Freecodebootcamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) .
1. I used a sandbos called [codepen](https://codepen.io/)
2. I Followed the instrucction on [Freecodebootcamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) about the course ["Responsive Web Design"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design) with their 8 [user stories#](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page).

As a result we can see my codepen screenshot:
